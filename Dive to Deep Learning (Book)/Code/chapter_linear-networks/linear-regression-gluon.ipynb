    "which defines a large number of neural network layers\n",
    "(note that \"nn\" is an abbreviation for neural networks).\n",
    "We will first define a model variable `net`, which is a `Sequential` instance. In Gluon, a `Sequential` instance can be regarded as a container\n",
    "that concatenates the various layers in sequence.\n",
    "When input data is given, each layer in the container will be calculated in order, and the output of one layer will be the input of the next layer.\n",
    "In this example, since our model consists of only one layer,\n",
    "we do not really need `Sequential`.\n",
