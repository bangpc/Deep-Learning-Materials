    "It is impossible to get anything done if we cannot manipulate data. Generally, there are two important things we need to do with data: (i) acquire it and (ii) process it once it is inside the computer. There is no point in acquiring data if we do not even know how to store it, so let's get our hands dirty first by playing with synthetic data. We will start by introducing the NDArray,\n",
    "MXNet's primary tool for storing and transforming data. If you have worked with NumPy before, you will notice that NDArrays are, by design, similar to NumPy's multi-dimensional array. However, they confer a few key advantages. First, NDArrays support asynchronous computation on CPU, GPU, and distributed cloud architectures. Second, they provide support for automatic differentiation. These properties make NDArray indispensable for deep learning.\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, we are aiming to get you up and running with the basic functionality. Do not worry if you do not understand all of the basic math, like element-wise operations or normal distributions. In the next two chapters we will take another pass at the same material, teaching the material in the context of practical examples. On the other hand, if you want to go deeper into the mathematical content, see :numref:`chapter_math`.\n",

For example, if we write `y = x + y`, we will dereference the matrix that `y` used to point to and instead point it at the newly allocated memory. In the following example we demonstrate this with Python's `id()` function, which gives us the exact address of the referenced object in memory. After running `y = y + x`, we will find that `id(y)` points to a different location. That is because Python first evaluates `y + x`, allocating new memory for the result and then subsequently redirects `y` to point at this new location in memory."
