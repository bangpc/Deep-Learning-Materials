    "In this section we begin to discuss how to harness this compute performance for your research. First by using single GPUs and at a later point, how to use multiple GPUs and multiple servers (with multiple GPUs). You might have noticed that MXNet NDArray looks almost identical to NumPy. But there are a few crucial differences. One of the key features that differentiates MXNet from NumPy is its support for diverse hardware devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MXNet, every array has a context. In fact, whenever we displayed an NDArray so far, it added a cryptic `@cpu(0)` notice to the output which remained unexplained so far. As we will discover, this just indicates that the computation is being executed on the CPU. Other contexts might be various GPUs. Things can get even hairier when we deploy jobs across multiple servers. By assigning arrays to contexts intelligently, we can minimize the time spent transferring data between devices. For example, when training neural networks on a server with a GPU, we typically prefer for the modelâ€™s parameters to live on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, for complex neural networks and large-scale data, using only CPUs for computation may be inefficient. In this section, we will discuss how to use a single NVIDIA GPU for calculations. First, make sure you have at least one NVIDIA GPU installed. Then, [download CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and follow the prompts to set the appropriate path. Once these preparations are complete, the `nvidia-smi` command can be used to view the graphics card information."

    "People use GPUs to do machine learning because they expect them to be fast. But transferring variables between contexts is slow. So we want you to be 100% certain that you want to do something slow before we let you do it. If MXNet just did the copy automatically without crashing then you might not realize that you had written some slow code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, transferring data between devices (CPU, GPUs, other machines) is something that is *much slower* than computation. It also makes parallelization a lot more difficult, since we have to wait for data to be sent (or rather to be received) before we can proceed with more operations. This is why copy operations should be taken with great care. As a rule of thumb, many small operations are much worse than one big operation. Moreover, several operations at a time are much better than many single operations interspersed in the code (unless you know what you're doing). This is the case since such operations can block if one device has to wait for the other before it can do something else. It's a bit like ordering your coffee in a queue rather than pre-ordering it by phone and finding out that it's ready when you are.\n",

    "In short, as long as all data and parameters are on the same device, we can learn models efficiently. In the following we will see several such examples.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* MXNet can specify devices for storage and calculation, such as CPU or GPU. By default, MXNet creates data in the main memory and then uses the CPU to calculate it.\n",
    "* MXNet requires all input data for calculation to be **on the same device**, be it CPU or the same GPU.\n",
    "* You can lose significant performance by moving data without care. A typical mistake is as follows: computing the loss for every minibatch on the GPU and reporting it back to the user on the commandline (or logging it in a NumPy array) will trigger a global interpreter lock which stalls all GPUs. It is much better to allocate memory for logging inside the GPU and only move larger logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try a larger computation task, such as the multiplication of large matrices, and see the difference in speed between the CPU and GPU. What about a task with a small amount of calculations?\n",
    "1. How should we read and write model parameters on the GPU?\n",
    "1. Measure the time it takes to compute 1000 matrix-matrix multiplications of $100 \\times 100$ matrices and log the matrix norm $\\mathrm{tr} M M^\\top$ one result at a time vs. keeping a log on the GPU and transferring only the final result.\n",
    "1. Measure how much time it takes to perform two matrix-matrix multiplications on two GPUs at the same time vs. in sequence on one GPU (hint - you should see almost linear scaling).\n",
