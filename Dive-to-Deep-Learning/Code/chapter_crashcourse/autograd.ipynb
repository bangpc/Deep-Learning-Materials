    "In machine learning, we *train* models, updating them successively so that they get better and better as they see more and more data. Usually, *getting better* means minimizing a *loss function*, a score that answers the question \"how *bad* is our model?\" With neural networks, we typically choose loss functions that are differentiable with respect to our parameters.\n",
    "Put simply, this means that for each of the model's parameters, we can determine how much *increasing* or *decreasing* it might affect the loss. While the calculations for taking these derivatives are straightforward, requiring only some basic calculus, for complex models, working out the updates by hand can be a pain (and often error-prone).\n",
    "\n",
    "The autograd package expedites this work by automatically calculating derivatives. And while many other libraries require that we compile a symbolic graph to take automatic derivatives, `autograd` allows us to take derivatives while writing  ordinary imperative code. Every time we pass data through our model, `autograd` builds a graph on the fly, tracking which data combined through which operations to produce the output. This graph enables `autograd` to subsequently backpropagate gradients on command. Here *backpropagate* simply means to trace through the compute graph, filling in the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter. If you are unfamiliar with some of the math, e.g. gradients, please refer to :numref:`chapter_math`."
