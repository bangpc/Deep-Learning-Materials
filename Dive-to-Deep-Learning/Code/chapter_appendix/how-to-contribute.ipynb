    "Contributions by [readers](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/graphs/contributors) help us improve this book. If you find a typo, an outdated link, something where you think we missed a citation, where the code doesn't look elegant or where an explanation is unclear, please contribute back and help us help our readers. While in regular books the delay between print runs (and thus between typo corrections) can be measured in years, it typically takes hours to days to incorporate an improvement in this book. This is all possible due to version control and continuous integration testing. To do so you need to install Git and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/pulls) to the GitHub repository. When your pull request is merged into the code repository by the author, you will become a contributor. In a nutshell the process works as described in the diagram below.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Install Git\n",
    "\n",
    "The Git open source book describes [how to install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/zh/v2). This typically works via `apt install git` on Ubuntu Linux, by installing the Xcode developer tools on macOS, or by using GitHub's [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com). If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to sign up for one [4].\n",

    "Enter the [address](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en/) of the book's code repository in your browser. Click on the `Fork` button in the red box at the top-right of the figure below, to make a copy of the repository of this book. This is now *your copy* and you can change it any way you want.\n",

Make sure that your local copy is up to date with the main repository if you decide to keep this fork around for longer. For now simply follow the instructions in :numref:`chapter_installation` to get started. The main difference is that you're now downloading *your own fork* of the repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "* You can use GitHub to contribute to this book.\n",
    "* Forking a repositoy is the first step to contributing, since it allows you to edit things locally and only contribute back once you're ready.\n",
    "* Pull requests are how contributions are being bundled up. Try not to submit huge pull requests since this makes them hard to understand and incorporate. Better send several smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Star and fork the `d2l-en` repository.\n",
    "1. Find some code that needs improvement and submit a pull request.\n",
    "1. Find a reference that we missed and submit a pull request.\n",
